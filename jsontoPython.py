import tensorflow as tf
import json

# Load your JSON data
json_data = 'your_json_string_here'
data = json.loads(json_data)

# Recreate the model architecture in TensorFlow
# This will depend on your specific model configuration
# Below is a simplified example

# Example of creating a simple sequential model
model = tf.keras.Sequential()

# Add each layer as per the JSON configuration
# For example, if you have a Conv2D layer in your JSON:
# model.add(tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(filters=8, kernel_size=(2, 8), activation='relu', input_shape=(43, 232, 1)))

# Continue adding all layers as per your JSON data...

# Compile the model (you'll need to specify the loss and optimizer according to your use case)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Once the model is created, you can load the weights
# You'll need to have the weights file in the appropriate format for TensorFlow in Python
# weights_path = 'path_to_converted_weights_file'
# model.load_weights(weights_path)

# Now your model is ready to use
